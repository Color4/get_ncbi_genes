# Get the NCBI Gene List

I wanted a simple gene list with one entry per gene (primary transcript), and its genomic coordinates. This was much harder than I thought it should be, so I'm sharing it here to hopefully help others who want this type of resource.

The initial .gff file was downloaded here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/guide/human/
